This folder is dedicated to data structures.

Data structures are:
- Dictionaries
- List
- Tuples
- Sets
And can include other stuff form the collections module.

The dictionnaries.py file contains information and code about dictionaries. It is well documented, however,
if there are any changes that can be done and/or corrections as well, then please send email and pull request.
